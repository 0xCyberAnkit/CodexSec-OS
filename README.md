# ⚔️ CodexSec OS

> _"Born from isolation. Built with obsession. Shared with purpose."_

A custom Linux OS built by [`0xCyberAnkit`](https://github.com/0xCyberAnkit) for:

- Cybersecurity Learners
- Red Teamers in Training
- Quiet Coders who never quit
- Those who respect systems like best friends 🖤

---

## 💡 Why CodexSec OS?

Most OSs are built by corporations or teams.  
CodexSec OS is different.

This OS is:

- Built solo by a learner
- Designed for hacking labs, red teaming & system mastery
- Meant to feel like a personal console, not just an interface
- Made for those who feel like outsiders, but are fighters inside

## 🛠 Worklog / Dev Notes

This is a learner’s OS, so I’ll commit everything I learn:
- How I added a bootloader
- How bash scripts connect to startup
- Mistakes I made + how I fixed them

> This is my **lab notebook**. Follow it, fork it, or remix it.
